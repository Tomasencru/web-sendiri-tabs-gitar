        <h3>1.<b> Blue - Yung Kai (10/10)</b></h3>
        <p>This song is not for beginners i know, but the thing is if you play this song on guitar, it's just beautiful.
            It's dynamic between lower range frequencies sound to high frequencies sound is just perfect.
            I suggest you to listen to Eddie Van Der Meer's cover of this song on YouTube, it's just amazing.
            The Difficulty is above my own arrangements, it around 9 - 9.5.</p>

            <p>I dont reccommend you to play his arrangements if you are planning to 
            change your open strings tunings frequently to standard tuning since it's on <abbr title="B F# B F# B D#"><b>Open B Tuning</b></abbr>, which is too far away from <abbr title="E A D G B E"><b>Standard Tuning</b></abbr>
            I suggested not to because it will eventually age your strings faster than it has to be since you wint back and forth from standard tuning to open B tuning.</p>

            <p>My Arrangement is not that far from standard tuning, just tune you B string up and your E string up once <abbr title="F A D G C E">Custom Tuning</abbr>. It's closer to ed's arrangements since i made it purposely sounds like ed's arrangements.
        </p>

        <h3>2.<b> I Don't Care - Ed-Sheeran & Justin Bieber (9.6/10)</b></h3>
        <p>This song is also not for beginners since there are so many techniques that you should learn before you jump to this song. The Tunings are <abbr title="D A D F# A D">Open D</abbr> which i think again, 
           it's not good if you are planning to change your open strings tunings frequently to standard tuning since it's on <abbr title="D A D F# A D"><b>Open D Tuning</b></abbr>, which is too far away from <abbr title="E A D G B E"><b>Standard Tuning</b></abbr>
           but if you have a second guitar, you can dedicate that guitar to be tuned on open D tuning permanently so you dont have to retune it everytime you want to play this song.



            <p> Originally arranged by Eddie Van Der Meer, and i don't have any of my own arrangement of this song.</p>

            <p>This song reminds me back at 2019 when my parents arent home, they went to another island to visit their parents, and i was left alone at home for a week.
                I remember playing this song on repeat for the whole week using my accoustic guitar while doing my homework, and it was just so relaxing.
                i dont mind how difficult this song is, i just learned it in 6 days and boom, i was able to play it. </p>
            <p>In this song i know the moment you know how priceless the song is to be played by your own fingers making you a fast learner which motivates you to learn the song faster
                than any kind of song that you dont like or maybe it has no rare or unique moments that recalls shivers such as nostalgic effects to your brain etc.</p>
