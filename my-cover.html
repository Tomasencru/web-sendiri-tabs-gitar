        <p>This song is a bit hard since the slides almost 5-7 frets away from the picking
            position, which makes it hard to play by beginners.
             Is it worth it to fight for? yes. your fingers will most likely be calloused so much
             especially on your pinky finger.
             <br>
             <br>
             Overall this song is good, great, calming and chilling. on the first three notes you can feel its shivers
             goes through your veins since its original music does that too.

            This song reminds me of where i was hospitalized for a week due to food poisoning, at the same time i was came
            home from gym thinking i couldnt do toilet normally because it was a leg day. Despite those burdens i got, 
            i found out my first anime which is a romance anime from instagram reels recommendation called "angel next door spoils me rotten".
            The reels recommendation was playing this song as the background music, and i was like "woah this song is so relaxing and calming",
            that day i found out the music and i started to learn it on guitar.
            so then, this song is about my first anime experience.
